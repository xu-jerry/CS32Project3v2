# GhostRacer Game
This was UCLA CS32 Winter 2020's Project 3, where I coded a game in C++ from a project skeleton and a project spec. The premise of the game is that it is post-apocalyptic LA, and the player is trying to survive on a highway infested with zombies by avoiding dangerous obstacles, finding goodies, and saving the human souls while not killing any pedestrians. The main code files are in the GhostRacer folder. This repo was made public on 4/23/21, after the course ended on 3/19/21. 

## Main Challenges
When coding this game, one of the most important aspects of computer science I learned was Object-Oriented Programming, specifically how to create different classes that inherited from one another in an organized fashion. In addition, this was the first large-scale project I tackled, spanning several files and many classes.
